# Overlay Annotations

This directory contains YAML files that add **community-contributed descriptions
and notes** to the auto-generated CS2 documentation.  They are merged into the
generated HTML at build time without touching the auto-generated schema files.

## Overlay formats

### Multi-entity format *(recommended)*

Place a single `<module>.yml` file in this directory.  Top-level keys are
entity (class / struct / enum) names; their values are the per-entity overlay
dicts.  This lets you document many entities in one file.

```yaml
# docs/overlays/server.yml
CCSPlayerController:
  description: >
    One-line or multi-line description of what this entity represents.
  notes: >
    Reverse-engineered notes, lifecycle behaviour, quirks, etc.
  warning: >
    Optional – shown in an amber box.
  fields:
    m_iPing:
      description: "Player ping in milliseconds."
      notes: "Updated approximately every 5 seconds."
    m_hPlayerPawn:
      description: "Handle to the player's active pawn entity."

CBaseEntity:
  description: "Base class for all server-side entities."
```

Supported modules follow the directory names under `DumpSource2/schemas/`
(e.g. `server`, `client`, `entity2`, `animgraphlib`, …) plus `protobufs`
for Protobuf files.

### Single-entity format *(legacy)*

One file per entity, placed in a subdirectory named after the module:

```
docs/overlays/<module>/<EntityName>.yml
```

The file content is the overlay dict directly (no top-level entity key).

```yaml
# docs/overlays/server/CCSPlayerController.yml  ← legacy path
description: >
  One-line or multi-line description of what this entity represents.
fields:
  m_iPing:
    description: "Player ping in milliseconds."
```

Both formats can coexist.  If the same entity key appears in both, the
single-entity file wins.

## Protobuf file overlays

For Protobuf files, use the stem of the `.proto` filename as the key:

```yaml
# docs/overlays/protobufs/cs_gameevents.yml  (single-file format)
description: "CS2-specific game event messages."

messages:
  CMsgTEFireBullets:
    description: "Temporary entity event broadcast when a player fires a weapon."
    notes: "Seed allows demo parsers to reproduce bullet spread."
    fields:
      seed:
        description: "PRNG seed used to reproduce the bullet spread trajectory."
      weapon_id:
        description: "Item definition index of the weapon fired."
```

Or use the multi-entity format in a single `protobufs.yml` file:

```yaml
# docs/overlays/protobufs.yml
cs_gameevents:
  description: "CS2-specific game event messages."
  messages:
    CMsgTEFireBullets:
      description: "Broadcast when a player fires."
```

---

## Game events overlays

For game events (from `.gameevents` files), use a file named `gameevents.yml`
in this directory.  Top-level keys are `description`, `notes`, and `events`.
Under `events`, each key is an event name; its value supports `description`,
`notes`, `warning`, and per-field annotations under `fields`:

```yaml
# docs/overlays/gameevents.yml
description: >
  Optional page-level description shown at the top of the Game Events page.
notes: >
  Optional page-level notes callout.
events:
  player_death:
    description: "Fired when a player is killed."
    notes: "This event extends the base engine player_death with CS2-specific fields."
    fields:
      headshot:
        description: "Whether the killing blow was a headshot."
      weapon:
        description: "Weapon classname used by the attacker."
        notes: "Does not include the 'weapon_' prefix."
  round_end:
    description: "Fired when a round ends."
    warning: "The 'reason' field uses CS-specific enum values not documented here."
```
